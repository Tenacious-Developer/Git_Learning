- `git --version` -----> Checks the version of git
- `git config --global user.name "Your Name"` ----->  set your global Git user name
- `git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"` ----->  set your global Git user email
- `git config --global user.name` -----> check for user name
- `git config --global user.email` -----> checks for user email
- `mkdir "name"` -----> create folder
- `ls` ---------------> list of the file
- `touch README.txt` --------> create file
- `cat README.txt` ----->  Displaying File Contents
- `cd ..` ----> one step previous
- `code .` -----> open vs code
- `ls -a` ------> show hidden folder 
- `git init` -> Powers your folder to be managed by git, and initialises a new empty repository. It also creates a .git folder that has all the relevant logic to manage versions of your project.
- `git status` -----> used in Git to display information about the current state of your Git repository.
- `Working Area` -> There can be a bunch of files that are not currently handled by git. It means that changes done or to be done in those files are not managed by git yet. A file which is in working area is considered to be not in the staging area. When we do git status and we see abunch if untracked files then these are actually called to be in the working area.
- `git add "file name"` -----> moves file from working area to staging area
- `Staging area` -> What all files are going to be part of the next version that we will create. This staging area is the place where git knows what changes will be done from the last version to the next version.
- `git rm --cached <file>` -----> moves file back from staging area to working area
- `Repository Area` -> This area actually contains the details of all you previous registered version. And the files in this area, git already manages them and knows their version history.
- `commit` -> Commit is a particular version of the project. It captures a snapshot of the project's staged changes and creates a version out of it.
- `git commit` -> registers staging changes to a commit.
- `git log` -> list downs all the commits of the repository. If you want to exit out of git log prompt press q.
- `git restore <file>` -> it removes all files changes from the staging area to be committed. This can be useful, if we did some dirty piece of code and now no more want it. Instead of deleting every change line by line, we can restore it or you can say restore last clean version of the file.
- `git restore --staged <file>` -> it removes file from changes from staging area to the working area. this only works if changes are in your staging area
- Diff between git rm and git restore ans: if you want to move the whole file back to the untracked state, then we do git rm, otherwise if we just want the changes to be moved in working area or staging area then we git restore.
