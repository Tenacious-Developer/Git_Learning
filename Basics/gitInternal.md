# Internal Working of Git  

- Git is dependent on Hashing and tree data structure.
- Git is like key, value pair, where key is the hash of data and value is the data. 
- Git use cryptographic hash function  SHA-1
- Hash value is always same for same data.
- Git compresses data in a blob and store some meta data about data.
- When we create a git init, it creates a git tree structure.
- `echo 'hello git' | git hash-object --stdin` : Output of echo, treat as input for hash-object and provide 40 digit  hash value like 8d0e41234f24b6da002d962a26c2495ea16a425f
- When we add all changes in git, it stores key value pair. key is the hash value and data store in a blob which is binary object.
- `tree .git` this command is used to see the .git folder in a tree like structure in the terminal.
- it shows all directory and blob hash value in object folder.
- To see the content of file we are using command `git cat-file -p hashvalue`
- we are missing other details of filename like directory details and sub directory details.
- for managing this blob is not sufficient, so we need other data structure like tree
- it contains pointers 
	- to store blob 
	- to store trees
- it contains meta data 
	- type of pointer (tree, blob)
	- directory name 
	- mode (permision for file)
- To see the type of the file we use command `git cat-file -t hashvalue`
- To see the tree object, we have to commit the changes. 
- commit stores as key value pair, key is the hash-value but value is not a blob object, not a tree but it's commit object
- commit object has details like
	- author
	- msg
	- date
	- time stamp
	- reference of the hash-value of the root directory of tree.
	- reference of the parent commit
- Because of the time stamp two commit has not same SHA-1 hash value.
